## Setup 

1. Open your Flutter project in a code editor.
2. Add the SDK to `pubspec.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     pushengage_flutter_sdk: ^0.0.1
3. Run:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get

## Demo project

We have added a demo project for showcasing the various features available and ways to interact with the SDK. The project can be found inside the ```\example``` folder.

Steps to run the sample project:
1. Clone this repo.
2. Open it in Visual Studio Code.
3. ```cd``` to ```/example``` -> ```ios``` and do a ```pod install``` (Only required if you want to run it on iOS)
4. ```cd``` to the root of the project
5. Run ```flutter pub get```
6. Select a simulator for iOS or emulator for Android: ```Command + Shift + P``` -> ```Flutter: Select Device```
7. Open the Run and Debug Panel from the left and click on Run and Debug. Based on the device selected, it will run the sample app on that device.
